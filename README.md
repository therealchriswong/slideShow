slideShow
=========

A slideshow using Jquery, CSS, and HTML.

Set the width of div that contains the slide images to the total width of all the images. Add an overflow to the div which hides the images that overflow out of the div. Add a controller that skips to the images in the slide show. A javascript event handles a click on the li bullet, which shifts the image to the main view by using a css translateX().
